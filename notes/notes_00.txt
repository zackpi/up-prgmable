Here's the 8085 simulator I'm using. It's the best one I've found:

Check out the code I wrote to see how I plan to do procedure calls and setting up the memory

PROCEDURE CALL:

	This is a slightly slower caller/receiver model because it doesn't destroy registers. This will make it easier for users, so I think it's worth it to do this for more complex functions (unlike the stupid simple one I used in the example)

	caller:
		store arguments in "arg" storage
		call automatically pushes PC to the STACK

	subroutine:
		save registers in STACK
		read args from "arg" storage
		return value in "and" storage
		restore registers from STACK
		ret pops PC from STACK, so pair all PUSHs w/ POPs inside subrout
